2. Assign a variable name to each of the following and use Python to identify the data type of
each variable:
```

3. Create a list named "A" containing all the values from above
4. Create a string named "B" containing the input "I like pie more than cake." Using string slicing, extract 
```

```
5. This question was part of an in-person interview where you were expected to write the code on a board: "Design a function in which I can input a value, when I input the value, it returns the 4 possible outputs":
```
If it is a multiple of 3 return the string "foo"
If it is a multiple of 5 return the string "bar"
If it is a multiple of 15 return the string "foobar"
If it does not satisfy any of those, return the string "Not a multiple of 3, 5, or 15"
```
